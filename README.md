Kidz Bop Kids
“Weird Al” Yankovic

Schedule for project



What I’m building?
A website that will answer the  question everyone has been asking "Has my favorite song been covered by "Weird Al" Yankovic or Kidz Bop. The page starts with a header that has a link on each side the left going to "Weird Al" Yankovics disocgraphy and the link to the right going to the Kidz Bop disocgraphy. Center of the header is the for the title of the page. Then below that is two images side by side first of "Weird Al" the second of Kidz Bop. If you hover over the images you will be able a description of the muscians should appear. Below that is a question "What if "Weird Al" Yankovic or Kidz Bop covered your favorite song?" under that you type in your favorite song into the search bar an alert will come up saying if it has been covered by "Weird Al" Yankovic or Kidz Bop.

Title ideas
What if “Weird Al” Yankovic or Kid’s Bop covered your favorite song?
Who is your spirit animal “Weird Al” Yankovic or the kid’s boppers?
Search bar to type in a song name
The results appear
with a picture of either 
Weird Al or Kid’s Bop kids 
with different alerts saying that your song has in fact been covered by either of them
If not a different alert will go off saying it has not been covered by either



What API am I going to use?
Spotify
other music api
Not sure as long as I can figure out how to get the artist discographies to link.
Spotify was too difficult to work with now I'm trying musixmatch.

where they are from
est amt of music
fun fact

Have to change "Weird Al" to Me First and the Gimme Gimmes. Because "Weird Al" changes the names from the original I would have to build a seperate api for "Weird Al" Yankovic with his songs and the originals.
